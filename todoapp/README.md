# Todo App

A simple application for managing tasks, allowing you to create, view, edit, and mark tasks as done (or move them back to the todo list).

## Overview

The Todo App consists of two main lists:

1. **Todo**: Shows all tasks that are not yet completed.
2. **Done**: Shows all tasks that have been marked as completed.

From either list, the user can:
- View and edit a specific task.
- Mark tasks as done or move them back to todo (depending on the screen).
- Add new tasks from the Todo screen.

Additional details:
- Closing any secondary screen (e.g., **New Task**, **Edit Task**) returns the user to the last primary list they viewed.
- Marking a task as done will remove it from the **Todo** list and place it in the **Done** list, and vice versa.
- Deleting a task (if supported) will remove it entirely from both lists.

## Screens and User Flows

### 1. Landing Page / Initial State

- **Purpose**: Show the user a starting point when they open the app.
- **Appearance**:
  - A simple screen with the app name or a quick navigation element.
  - A prominent button or toggle to access the **Todo** list and the **Done** list.
- **Behavior**:
  - By default, the app may either:
    1. **Start on the Todo screen** (most common approach).
    2. Show a minimal home screen with two buttons: “Go to Todo” and “Go to Done”.

> **Possible Implementation**: For simplicity, the wireframe suggests the user might land on the **Done** screen first. However, the typical convention is to start on **Todo**. See [Assumptions](#assumptions).

---

### 2. Todo Screen

- **Purpose**: Display all tasks that are pending or not yet completed.
- **Layout**:
  1. **Header**: Title (e.g., “Todo”) and possibly a button or icon to switch to the **Done** screen.
  2. **Task List**: A list of task items. Each item typically includes:
     - Task title (and possibly a short description if the design allows).
     - A checkbox or marker indicating its state (unchecked if it’s not done).
     - (Optional) A small icon or text to edit the task.
  3. **Add New Task Button**: A button or “+” icon to create a new task. 
     - Clicking this opens the **New Task Screen**.
- **Behavior**:
  1. **Selecting a Task**: 
     - If the user taps on a task, it might either:
       - Immediately mark the task as done, removing it from the **Todo** list and placing it into the **Done** list.
       - Or open the **Edit Task Screen** if the user wants to see more details or make changes. 
     - The wireframe suggests that clicking on a task will make it “disappear” from the current list (i.e., it’s now done). 
  2. **Navigating to Done**:
     - The user can switch to the **Done** screen via a navigation element (e.g., header button, tab, or side menu).

---

### 3. Done Screen

- **Purpose**: Display all tasks that have been completed.
- **Layout**:
  1. **Header**: Title (e.g., “Done”) and a button or icon to switch back to **Todo**.
  2. **Completed Task List**: Each item in this list:
     - Shows a checked box or visual indicator that the task is done.
     - May allow the user to uncheck or revert the task back to **Todo**.
  3. **(Optional) Edit Option**: If you allow editing a completed task, clicking on it could open the **Edit Task Screen**. 
- **Behavior**:
  1. **Selecting a Task**:
     - Tapping on a completed task may:
       - Move it back to the **Todo** list (if the user wants to “un-complete” it).
       - Open an edit screen for the task.
  2. **Navigation**:
     - The user can switch back to **Todo** using a navigation element in the header.

---

### 4. New Task Screen

- **Purpose**: Create a new task with details (title, description, due date, etc.).
- **Layout**:
  1. **Header**: Typically says “New Task” or “Add Task”.
  2. **Input Fields**:
     - **Title** (required).
     - **Description** (optional).
     - **Due Date** (optional).
     - Additional fields if needed (priority, tags, etc.).
  3. **Buttons**:
     - **Save**: Saves the new task and returns the user to the **Todo** screen.
     - **Cancel / Close**: Discards changes and returns the user to the **Todo** screen.
- **Behavior**:
  1. **Saving**:
     - On save, the new task is created and added to the **Todo** list.
     - The user is redirected back to the **Todo** screen, where the new task is visible.
  2. **Canceling**:
     - If the user cancels, no task is created.
     - The user returns to the **Todo** screen.

---

### 5. Edit Task Screen

- **Purpose**: View or modify existing task details.
- **Layout**:
  1. **Header**: Typically shows “Edit Task” or the task’s title.
  2. **Fields**:
     - **Title** (editable).
     - **Description** (editable).
     - **Due Date** (editable).
     - **Status** (done or not done).
  3. **Buttons**:
     - **Save**: Commits changes to the task and returns to the relevant list (Todo or Done).
     - **Cancel / Close**: Discards changes and returns to the previous list (Todo or Done).
     - **Delete** (optional): Removes the task entirely from the application (both Todo and Done).
- **Behavior**:
  1. **Saving**:
     - Updates the existing task and returns the user to whichever list they came from (Todo or Done).
  2. **Canceling**:
     - Discards changes, returning to the previous list.
  3. **Deleting** (if implemented):
     - Removes the task from the application completely.
     - Redirects to the previous list with the task removed.

## Navigation

1. **Between Todo and Done**:  
   - A button or tab in the header toggles between the two primary lists.
   - Alternatively, a side menu or bottom navigation bar could exist (not explicitly shown in the wireframe but common in mobile apps).
2. **From Todo / Done to New Task**:  
   - Pressing the “+” or “Add Task” button on the Todo screen opens **New Task**.
3. **From Todo / Done to Edit Task**:  
   - Tapping on a task can open the **Edit Task** screen (depending on whether the immediate action is to mark it done/undone or to edit it; see [Assumptions](#assumptions)).
4. **Closing Screens**:  
   - Closing the **New Task** screen returns to **Todo**.
   - Closing the **Edit Task** screen returns to either **Todo** or **Done**, whichever was active.
5. **Marking a Task Done**:  
   - Moves the task from Todo to Done instantly (the item disappears from Todo and appears in Done).
6. **Marking a Task Undone**:  
   - Moves the task from Done to Todo instantly (the item disappears from Done and appears in Todo).

---

## Assumptions

1. **Default Screen**: In this README, we assume the user starts on **Todo** (though this can be configured).
2. **Immediate vs. Edit**: When the user taps a task in the **Todo** screen, the wireframe implies it *disappears* (i.e., marked done). We assume that:
   - **Primary Tap** = Mark task as done/undone.
   - **Secondary Action** (e.g., a small “Edit” icon) = Open the **Edit Task** screen.  
   This could also be reversed or combined in a context menu, depending on design preference.
3. **Data Storage**: We assume tasks are stored locally (e.g., local storage or an internal database) for simplicity, as the wireframe does not mention server synchronization.
4. **Delete Feature**: The wireframe does not explicitly show a “Delete Task” button. We included it in the **Edit Task Screen** as a possible feature. If deleting tasks is out of scope, it can be removed.
5. **Due Date / Priority**: The wireframe does not show date or priority fields, but we included them as typical fields for a todo app. These fields are optional.
6. **Single-User**: The wireframe suggests a single-user experience (no login or multi-user scenarios). 
7. **Styling and Animations**: It will use the Cupertino library
